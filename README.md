Systems Analysis and Design was all about roles and the systems in place to define, establish, and perform those roles. Entity relationships diagrams were a huge part of this course. Another major focus of this course was developing the skills to take stakeholder input and apply it to solutions. Every week, I was presented a different scenario about a fictional business and had to research, problem solve, and analyze information to provide a solution for that weeks dilemma. The attached files are some examples of the research and solutions that I came up with over the duration of this course.
